# Discord Moderation Bot

## Project Overview
Develop a discord moderation bot to help manage servers efficiently.

## Features
- Auto-moderation tools to kick, ban, or warn users based on specified criteria.
- Customizable filter settings for offensive language, spam, or inappropriate content.
- Logging system to track moderation actions and user behavior.
- Mute functionality to prevent disruptive users from sending messages.
- Command-based system for moderators to easily execute actions.
- Role-based permissions to control access to moderation commands.
- Timed bans and mutes for temporary disciplinary actions.

## Enhancements
- Integration with a spam detection system for more accurate filtering.
- Machine learning algorithms for improved detection of toxic behavior.
- User-friendly dashboard for configuring bot settings without code.
- Multi-server support to manage moderation across multiple discord servers.
- Regular updates and bug fixes to ensure bot reliability and effectiveness.

## Programming Languages
Python will be used for developing the discord moderation bot due to its ease of use and extensive libraries.

## APIs
Discord.py API will be integrated to interact with the Discord API and perform moderation actions within servers effectively.

## Packages and Libraries
- discord.py (latest version) - for interacting with Discord servers and users.
- pandas (latest version) - for managing and analyzing data related to moderation actions and user behavior.
- scikit-learn (latest version) - for implementing machine learning algorithms for toxic behavior detection.
- Flask (latest version) - for creating a user-friendly dashboard to configure bot settings.

## Rationale
- Python is widely used in the development of Discord bots, offering a simple syntax and robust libraries.
- Discord.py API provides a direct interface to Discord servers, allowing seamless moderation actions.
- pandas is essential for handling and analyzing data logs related to moderation activities.
- scikit-learn offers powerful tools for implementing machine learning algorithms to enhance toxic behavior detection.
- Flask enables the creation of a web-based dashboard for easy configuration without the need for coding skills.

## Conclusion
Developing the discord moderation bot using Python with discord.py API, along with integrating pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask, will ensure efficient moderation features, accurate filtering, and user-friendly customization options.
